About 48 hrs after my interview with Annette, I received an acceptance e-mail. I'm very thankful that they believed I had what it takes to succeed in this course. I was actually in a bit of withdrawal the last 48 hrs prior to the acceptance email, mainly because I had started to establish a routine in which I was completing labs and lectures into the wee hours. Naturally, upon acceptance I went ahead and paid for the first month, excitedly knowing that first thing in the morning I could get started with the **600-800** hr course.
