Up until this point majority of my coding experience has been completing quick tutorials such as the Rails tutorial available at [One Month Rails](https://onemonth.com/) and Daniel Kehoe's tutorial at [Learn-Rails.com](http://learn-rails.com//). I found these tutorials to be a very solid spark in igniting my thirst for more. I have been told before that this style of learning, while informative, are mainly to get your feet wet. Much of the material will flow right through you, however, upon completion you are given your first taste into that feeling of satisfaction programmers feel throughout their career. Here is a quick overview of both of these programs and my thoughts about them.

### One Month Rails

+ **cost:** $49 per month 
+ **medium:** Online text and video
+ **time:** Roughly 1 week on and off

I found One Month to be a fairly solid course, while the course is a outdated (I believe it was launched 2013), they have a solid support team that updates the material when needed. It's fast paced, doesn't really explain much of the actual code, majority of it is available on the screen for you to simply paste into your editor. I found myself pausing the video several times and simply copying code. They go into bootstrap, encourage you to experiment with your own customisation, and upon compeletion, you should have a fairly working Pinterest clone.

### Learn-Rails.com

+ **cost:** $.99 <-- _for real_ 
+ **medium:** Online text 
+ **time:** 3 days

I found Daniel Kehoe's tutorial through reddit. He was doing some sort of special offer, and for less than a dollar, I signed up. The tutorial is broken down into two books. The first book doesn't have any coding, rather, goes into explaining what is Rails, how to be successful in learning how to code, as well as a quick overview of other languages. This book can be read in a sitting or two. The second book follows the building of your first ever rails app. Many of its chapters are great topics, however just pierce the surface to include

+ Git
+ Front-End Frameworks
+ Basic Ruby
+ Routes and MVC
+ Heroku and deploying (my favorite chapter)
+ Intro to Testing

Kehoe's tutorial packs a lot of info, and skims the surface of a lot of topics for beginners. The entire course is fed to you text based, and if that style of learning is not your best, you can get bored pretty quickly. Nonetheless it is more than worth it for the cost and learning how to quickly deploy on heroku was more than worth it.

### Final Words

Do not go into these style tutorials thinking you will be any sort of programmer upon completion, you wont be. Instead use them for what they are intended for, to get the ball rolling and a trial by fire into the world of coding.
