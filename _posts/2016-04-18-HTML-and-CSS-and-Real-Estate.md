###Week #1 is Officially a Wrap

Today marked exactly one week since I signed up for [Learn.co's](http://www.learn.co) Verified program. I had previously planned to be starting the CSS portion by the end of the week, but I was finding the material pretty, so I simply kept powering through. The fruits of my labor has led to exploring CSS for the first time, as well as building a Real Estate site from scratch **Twice!** Ok, maybe not twice, but it was really cool to follow along and see the process of converting a static HTML and CSS site to be full on responsive with Twitter Bootstrap components and javascript elements. I found myself by the end of the codealongs feeling really satisfied that I was able to follow along, and at times was even a head of the instructor in the videos.

CSS, being something I've never really touched before, was a great learning experience. I know that if I keep experimenting with it that I can really ge the basics down. Now I know it can get **alot** more complicated and in depth, and there are a lot of things I still don't know you can do with CSS, but understanding the basics for now should be more than enough to be able to begin putting decent looking projects together. I'm really glad we got an introduction into media queries and responsiveness, it really helped me see the magic behind Web 2.0 sites and their ability to simply look good on all platforms. It's not all a mystery to me now. 

###Bootstrap

Bootsrap certainly deserves its own paragraph. While I have messed around with bootstrap before, our implementation of it into this Realty site was a real eye opener for me. There's a lot of power behind this framework. It simply allows you to be able to get responsive, clean, and nice looking sites up and running quickly and easily. Now when people say that they are "bootstrapping" their business or startup, it can literally mean more than one thing, lol!
