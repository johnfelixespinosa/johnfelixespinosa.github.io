### Week #1 is Officially a Wrap

Today marked exactly one week since I signed up for [Learn.co's](http://www.learn.co) Verified program. I had previously planned to be starting the CSS portion by the end of the week, but I was finding the material really fun, so I simply kept powering through. The fruits of my labor has led to exploring CSS for the first time, as well as building a Real Estate site from scratch **Twice!** Ok, maybe not twice, but it was really cool to follow along and see the process of converting a static HTML and CSS site to be full on responsive with Twitter Bootstrap components and javascript elements. I found myself by the end of the codealongs feeling really satisfied that I was able to follow along, and at times was even a head of the instructor in the videos.

CSS, being something I've never really touched before, was a great learning experience. I know that if I keep experimenting with it that I can really ge the basics down. Now, I know it can get **alot** more complicated and in depth, and there are a lot of things I still don't know you can do with CSS, but understanding the basics for now should be more than enough to be able to begin putting decent looking projects together. I'm really glad we got an introduction into media queries and responsiveness, it really helped me see the magic behind Web 2.0 sites and their ability to simply look good on all platforms. It's not all a mystery to me now. 

### Bootstrap

Bootstrap certainly deserves its own paragraph. While I have messed around with bootstrap before, our implementation of it into this Realty site was a real eye opener for me. There's a lot of power behind this framework. It simply allows you to be able to get responsive, clean, and nice looking sites up and running quickly and easily. Now when people say that they are "bootstrapping" their business or startup, it can literally mean more than one thing, lol! 

### Moving Forward

I'll be diving into the Procedural Ruby section now, and this section should take anywhere from two maybe three weeks, depending on how stuck I get on some portions. I've decided to put down [Eloquent Ruby by Russ Olsen](http://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321584104) for now, as I was getting into the first few chapters I quickly realized it was still a bit to advanced for me. I decided instead to get into [The Well-Grounded Rubyist by David Black](http://www.amazon.com/The-Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1933988657) as I've heard its a better book for beginners. I will most likely re-explore Eloquent again afterwards.

### The Well-Grounded Rubyist by David Black

+ **cost:** $12.74  
+ **medium:** Paperback

My goal for this Procedural Ruby section is to complete it in two and half to three weeks. I hope by the end of it I can have a better understanding of basic Ruby and not feel totally intimidated everytime I open a new .rb file to explore. 

### Livecoding

This week I also streamed my first [Livecoding.tv](https://www.livecoding.tv/johnfelixespinosa/) episode. I streamed to a few viewers as I was completing one of my CSS labs. I hope that by the end of this program to have several streams up on my channel with the intention of adding it to my resume for potential employers to peruse if they wish to do so.

Here's to Week #1 in the books, and hoping for continued success, until next time.
