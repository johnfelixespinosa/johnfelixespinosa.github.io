###Week 1 is officially in the books

Today marked exactly one week since I signed up for [Learn.co's Verified](http://www.learn.co) program. I had previously planned to be starting the CSS portion by the end of the week, but I was finding the material pretty fun and rewarding so I simply kept powering through. The fruits of my labor has led to exploring CSS for the first time, as well as building a Real Estate site from scratch **Twice**! Ok, maybe not twice, but it was really cool to follow along and see the process of converting a static HTML and CSS site to be full on responsive with Twitter Bootstrap components and javascript elements. I found myself by the end of the codealongs feeling really satisfied that I was able to follow along, and at times was even a head of the instructor in the videos.
