> So I've plateaued... sigh. August of last year was when I began this journey to physical fitness. My heaviest weight I remember seeing on my scale was 225 lbs. On a 5'6" frame, that was not a pretty sight. It was the wake up call I needed, and once I began hitting the gym and following a *lax* keto diet, the weight melted off. Additionally my goal weight kept changing. First I wanted to get down to a comfortable 185 lbs. When I smashed that goal weight I said, 175 lbs and *"I'm good!"*, Well 175 lbs came and I said "Hey might as well go for visible abs". I hit 165 lbs, and then I got stuck. I've been hovering 165 lbs since the new year. While my physique has arguably been getting nicer, I still haven't reached that goal of chiseled abs, and Brad Pitt in Fight Club physique. So with the summer coming to a close, here's a serious go at it. New goal weight is 152 lbs. I don't really think I'll hit it in 30 days, that's just an aggressive goal, but before my 29th birthday, September 26th would be amazing.
