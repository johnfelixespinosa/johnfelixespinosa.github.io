As I neared the end of the Rails portion of my curriculum, I had already begun brainstorming on what sort of application to build for my Portfolio project. Like many developers, and I'd wager, not just beginners but devs of all levels, I struggled to come up with anything worthwhile for myself to build, much less any idea that kept my interest level past entering the ever familiar

```ruby
rails new some-app
rails g model user
```

into my console. It was starting to become a real roadblock to me completing the Rails section.  

One night, burning the midnight oil, indulging in one of my favorite time suck activities, browsing Reddit and Electronic Cyber Deals, I noticed something in my browser that I had never really paid much attention to before, sans working on a dev project of my own. The browsers address bar.   

I don't know if it was due to dynamic routes and RESTful conventions still being fresh in my mind, or if I was just up way past my bedtime, but the site I was surfing at the time was a site designed to pick out individual parts for a computer build. Each user on the site could create these parts lists and then create pages that shared their computers and setups with the world. I was deep into researching the new graphics cards that were recently released by Nvidia, and talking myself into possibly picking one up during the Cyber Monday deals, when my attention was no longer about the content of the site, but more so the structure of the site. I found myself clicking all the links on the site not interested at all, at the pictures or information but simply what was in the address bar, the routing, the mapping, it was a delight to explore a website in a way I had never explored before. I remember having revelations and thinking,    
> "ah ha! that must be a class, and that must be a class, that object belongs to that object, that object has many of those, wow this site is full of all types of classes and objects, but its not complicated at all! I could totally build this!"

Armed with a structure that was practically laid out for me, I knew what I wanted to build. Not only was the discovery of what I have since coined as **Devs Web _verb_ :the act of surfing the web through the eyes of a developer**, but I was also working on a project that seriously interested me. Each time I opened up my laptop with a preplanned time block to work on my project, I found eachtime that I was quickly working past my alloted time. It was enjoyable and a blast. I loved every second I worked on this project.
