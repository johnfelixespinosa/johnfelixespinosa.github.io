One of the most common features to be implemented in a web application is the ability to specify roles. Much like the last time I implemented a roles feature [(here)](https://github.com/johnfelixespinosa/React-Practice/tree/master/instagram-mock), it took me longer than it should have. Going one direction, only to switch gears in another, to coming full circle back in the original direction.
