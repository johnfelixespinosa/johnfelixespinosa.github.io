[![](Rails w/ JS)](/img/railsjsScreenshot1.png)

Incorporating javascript features into my rails app, [PC Builder](https://github.com/johnfelixespinosa/pc_builder), was quite challenging and yet rewarding at the same time. To meet the requirements I ended up incorporating features such as Handlebars and active model serializers to template and handle JSON requests. Some of the things and tips that got me through the process are as follows.

## 1. console.log('I'm your friend')
  Juggling variables, responses, and maintaining the state of objects in your head can quickly set you down a rabbit hole, where now you don't know what anything is and what anything is supposed to do. Being able to keep track of things instinctively is just a coding level up that comes with more time and experience. Once you have written dozens of ajax requests, implemented countless methods on prototypes, and simply have had more time with the language and technologies, only then will things become second nature. Until then, arguably, even then, console.logging is your best friend. Don't be afraid to use it. Know what things are!

## 2. Undefined means just that, undefined
  Halfway through my refactor, I spent a good two hours on an undefined error. 
  ![undefined](/img/undefinedss.png)
  I had a constructor for a comment object like so...

  ```javascript
  class Comment{
    constructor(attributes){
    this.body = attributes.body;
    this.created_at = attributes.created_at.slice(0,10);
    this.user_id = attributes.user_id;
    this.username = attributes.username
    this.build_id = attributes.build_id;
    }
  }
   ```
   however, username was always registering in the console as undefined. I checked my comments_serializer and couldn't understand why.

   ```ruby
    class CommentSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
      attributes :id, :created_at, :user_id, :build_id, :body, :username
      belongs_to :user
      belongs_to :build
    end
   ```
   My JSON, clearly had the user attribute...

   ```json
     {id: 19, created_at: "2019-02-25T21:34:01.059Z", user_id: 1, build_id: 3, body: "please work!", …}
      body: "please work!"
      build: {id: 3, title: "2019 Gaming monster", description: "My first (and ungraceful) build was piecemealed to…ught over, it will be a far cry from this device."}
      build_id: 3
      created_at: "2019-02-25T21:34:01.059Z"
      id: 19
      user: {id: 1, username: "John Espinosa"}
      user_id: 1
      __proto__: Object
   ```

   It wasn't until I made the realization that my Comment model, was referencing a User model, that the rediculous error was ofcourse going to return undefined! There was no username attribute for the comment, however there was a user.username attribute, since well, a comment belongs to a user right? Removing the **username** attribute from the serializer, and changing the constructor attribute **this.username = attributes.username** to **this.username = attributes.user.username** fixed this error, and admittedly I felt rather silly afterwards. 

   ## 3. Precompile

   I had an issue where when I first incorporated a Handlebars template using the [Handlebars-assets](https://github.com/leshill/handlebars_assets) gem, I was getting the error that HandlebarsTemplates doesn't exist. Reading through the documentation lead me to the section regarding precompiling assets. Handlebars and templates were added to my application.js so it should be loading correct? Well they weren't not until I shutdown the server, ran 
   ```ruby
   $ RAILS_ENV=production bin/rails assets:precompile
   ```
   and then restarted the server. You can check which assets are loading with your application by simply viewing the page source and seeing the listed assets, if the asset you wish to target is not listed, then either something is wrong with your asset tree, or compiling is necessary.

   ## Conclusion

   Javascript is cool. Using it can make rails apps come alive. It's rewarding in nature, as the features and functions you build can be experienced first hand, instantly and visually. From asychronously rendering a new object within an index, to changing a css class upon a user click without a page refresh, it's powerful.
