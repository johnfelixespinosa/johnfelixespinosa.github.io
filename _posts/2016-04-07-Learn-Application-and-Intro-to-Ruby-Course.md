Well there it is, my Learn.co profile, the result of the last ten days of diligently wokring my way through the free course work. After completing the challenging Ruby track, I must say that I am fully bought in, into Learn's application and style of teaching. The coursework is broken down into two main components. There are the text lessons that will include pictures and sometimes video. And then there are the labs. The labs are actual repos that can be pulled and can be quite challenging at times. Several of the labs took me hours, sometimes a day or more to complete. I can honestly say that my understanding of Ruby basics has grown tremendously just through this free course and the last ten days. The way the learning is setup, if you fully commit, it can get addicting. Many days I found myself up at 3am reading, experimenting, and attempting to get tests to pass. 

The community on Learn is fairly active. They include a slack channel for all the persons doing the free coursework, this channel was a bit uneventful as many users come and they go. Dozens of persons I assume who have created a profile, many to be never seen again. I did catch one conversation between two users explaining that the channels for the _verified_ students is much more active, so that is something to look forward to if I do decide to continue with Learns program. Perhaps the most helpful community feature is the "ask a question" system. The response from other students and the staff is **very** quick. I had to use the feature 3 or 4 times, and each time the individuals who decided to chime in were able to help me move along in whatever lab I was completing. I can only imagine this feature gets better as you move from the free course to the actual paid students course. All in all the learning was very enjoyable for me. The sense of accomplishment completing lab after lab was very rewarding, and I admittedly felt part of a "community" throughout the 10 days. 

### Learn Verified

Learn.co is the online arm of New Yorks [Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com/). It is the same curriculum the on campus students go through, just strictly online and at ones own pace. The Learn Verified (paying students) are also guaranteed job placement within 6 months of course completion as the Flatiron grads are. Online students still have access to code reviews, teacher assistants, webinars, and the like. I think it's a good platform for individuals who cannot commit to 3 months of relocation and learning on site, however, much like all online courses, the motivation to succeed is strictly up to the student. If the program is as engaging and in depth as the Ruby Intro Track was, I think I will enjoy being Verified very much. That is if I gain admission.

### Application Process

Upon signing up for an account, Learn gives you full access to their free Intro to Ruby Web Dev course. By linking you github and setting up your environment to run with their Learn App, you are ready to go. Naturally as you progress through the course you will be given the ability to start and application with them. 

+ **Part 1**
A short 200 word essay simply explaining your reasons for wanting to get into code, possibly a short bio

+ **Part 2**
A very quick, 30 second video introducing yourself and talking about your experiences so far with learning to code

+ **Part 3**
20 minute interview with a Learn team member, very informal, no coding questions, just elaborating on your goals, and I guess for them to see if you would be a good fit for their program

I completed the 20 minute interview earlier today with Annette, a very nice young lady who was head of admissions for Learn and I believe Flatiron as well. We talked more about the program, she asked a few questions about myself and why this is something I want to pursue, and ofcourse we talked about cost and time commitment for students. I expressed my desire to continue with this course as I very much enjoyed the free course, and this platform for learning. I think it went well. In two days time I'll learn whether or not they'll have me. Until then I'll crack into the Ruby books I've purchased and continue with finding Ruby coursework to tackle.
