oh-haay! is an application that directly populates a users groups through the Meetup API allowing them
to see fellow group members whilst updating their status and informing others of their objectives for
attending. I first got the idea for oh-haay! due to my frustration of not being able to remember the
names, faces, and objectives of all the fellow attendees at the local meetups I would attend. oh-haay!
serves as an awesome way to fix that. Let others know what it is you're working on and also see what
everyone else is working on. Build connections, help others out, get help, all while meeting your fellow devs!
