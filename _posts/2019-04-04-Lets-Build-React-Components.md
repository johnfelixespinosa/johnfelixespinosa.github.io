In order to get a better understanding of React components, how to build and structure them, I set out to build a few small apps to practice and also start committing to memory the common syntax and nuances of React. These projects were super fun to complete, and in the end I felt a bit more confident in my ability. Just starting out in React? Try these out! Or think of a few of your own. The main focus here is breaking down components and mastering the basics. Credit goes to Dave Ceddia over at [Pure React](https://daveceddia.com/pure-react/), I purchased his course and some of these excercises were his, allowing me to use much of his css files, but the components I wrote on my own. You can also see the entire repo of my React practice apps on my Github at [React Practice](https://github.com/johnfelixespinosa/React-Practice), or click the titles for each respective repo.
