About 48 hrs after my interview with Annette, I received an acceptance e-mail. I'm very thankful that they believed I had what it takes to succeed in this course. I was actually in a bit of withdrawal the last 48 hrs prior to the acceptance email, mainly because I had started to establish a routine in which I was completing labs and lectures into the wee hours. Because of this, upon acceptance I went ahead and paid for the first month, excitedly knowing that first thing in the morning I could get started with the **600-800** hr course. 

### Learn.co (Verified)

+ **cost:** $500.00 _(50% Discounted Rate for 1st month)_
+ **medium:** Full Online Access, NY Campus Access, Video Lectures, Community 
+ **time:** First Month Payment

Upon payment for your first month, you are then given access to all the resources that will ultimately help you succeed in the course. Invitation into the private Slack channels, which interestingly I noticed...

> 315 members

Wow! Thats awesome. I suspect possibly half of these members are from the original batch of Learn verified students from around November 2015, many are nearing completion. While we don't necessarily have _"cohorts,"_ in Learn-Verified, I do realize that these 315 members are **VERY IMPORTANT** to Flatiron and Learn. Mainly because I suspect many of us will be included in their 2016 Jobs report [(Flatiron 2015 Jobs Report Here).](http://flatironschool.com/jobs-report-2015) I have no doubt the caliber of the students in the Verified program, skimming through many of their profiles, and the activity in the channels, as well as the list of student blogs we are given. There are some very driven students in this program. Being in company of others who are just as motivated as you, leads to success. Maybe as I build relations with some of the similarly paced students, I'll try to plan a meetup of some sorts. We'll see...

### Ready, Set, Go!

![100 Lessons](/img/100LessonsSS.png)

Not in the mood to slow down at all, I'm keeping my pace. Granted the first few modules are focused on GIT and HTML. I'm being diligent and not skipping any of the material. I've grown accustomed to Learn's style of building and building on previous lessons, so I'll take the ordered approach and not skip around and follow the curriculum as they've laid it out. It looks like if I keep pace, by the end of the week I can be moving into CSS, which I'm excited for. The HTML is mostly a refresher from my teenage years, where coding blogs and little homepages in HTML was the norm. Heck, I still remember customizing AOL profiles with HTML. I'll enjoy it for now, as I know it will get much tougher real soon. Inbetween grinding away at lessons and labs, I've decided to pick up [Eloquent Ruby by Russ Olsen](http://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321584104) and start reading it. Once I get further into it, I'll let you guys know all about it.
