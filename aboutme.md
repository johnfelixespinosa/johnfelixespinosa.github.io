My name is John Espinosa. I'm a small business owner currently residing in Virginia Beach, Virginia. This blog
is my own personal account of my journey to becoming a full stack developer. I first embarked on this journey 
around 2014, but as business grew, and schedules became full, I found myself constantly putting this goal
on the _backburner_.  

####End of 2015
The end of 2015 was a turning point for me. My business became self-sustaining, with a team firmly in place
to handle the day to day, my schedule freed up. 


### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
