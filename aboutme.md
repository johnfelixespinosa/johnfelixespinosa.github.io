My name is John Espinosa. I'm a small business owner currently residing in Virginia Beach, Virginia. This blog
is my own personal account of my journey to becoming a full stack developer. I first embarked on this journey 
around 2013, but as business grew, and schedules became full, I found myself constantly putting this goal
on the _backburner_. The end of 2015 rolled around, and I had been building up to this point for two years. My business had become self-sustaining, with a qualified team firmly planted in place, my schedule freed up. 

Not to leave *any* life goals in the _incomplete_ column of my perpetual _must do's_ list. I've since refocused, pulled up my britches, and am diving in headfirst. Included below is a condensed timeline/list of what I have been up to prior to this journey, and a look into my accomplishments thus far.

#### 2006 - 2010
The end of 2015 was a turning point for me. My business became self-sustaining, with a team firmly in place
to handle the day to day, my schedule freed up. 


### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
