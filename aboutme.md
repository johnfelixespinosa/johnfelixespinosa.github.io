My name is John Espinosa. I'm a small business owner currently residing in Virginia Beach, Virginia. This blog
is my own personal account of my journey to becoming a full stack developer. I first embarked on this journey 
around 2013, but as business grew, and schedules became full, I found myself constantly putting this goal
on the _backburner_. The end of 2015 rolled around, and I had been building up to this point for two years. My business had become self-sustaining, with a qualified team firmly planted in place, my schedule freed up. 

Not one to leave **any** life goals in the _incomplete_ column of my perpetual _must do's_ list. I've since refocused, pulled up my britches, made shelf space, and am diving in headfirst. 

### what you will find

I will be featuring posts on this site to include what I'm currently working on, coding, business, travel, and a slew of random posts regarding hobbies and my interests. I will also feature a running review of any and all resources that I use throughout my journey to Full Stack complete with investment and time costs. Treat this as a personal case study and ledger. My goal is to possibly share with others who wish to embark on learning programming a blueprint or a look into anothers journey.
